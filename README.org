#+TITLE: dotfiles
These are my dotfiles.  I use this repository as a personal backup and for
synchronization between my machines.
* Setup
  Invoking make will create a symlink in your home directory for each file in
  this directory that starts with a dot.

  The special target for st will download the PKGBUILD from the AUR, clone
  the st repository, apply my and some other patches, build the package and
  finally install it.
* Contribution
  These are MY dotfiles.  I use this repository as a PERSONAL backup and for
  synchronization between MY machines.

  If you have a great additions in mind, consider creating your own dotfiles
  repository and I will steal it from you.  If you are really kind, open an
  issue and point me to your solution.

  No pull requests.  I will test everything locally and tweak with it a bit,
  then I'll commit it once I'm content.
